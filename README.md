# Extreme Last Card

A game I made when I was 12, now updated and improved!

## Game Objective
Get rid of your cards. ASAP. (just like regular last card)

## Game Rules

Each player is given the same amount of random cards in their hand, this can be between 5-10 cards. There will be a right-side-up facing card in the middle of the playing table (aka the middle card) which is benign. You will then take turns placing compatible cards on the middle card, which varies based on the mode that the game is in. The person who gets rid of their cards first is the winner!

There are two modes to the game - *Normal Mode* and *Fight Mode*.

### In Normal Mode
The game *ALWAYS* starts in normal mode. To get rid of your cards you have to place matching cards ontop of the middle card. If you cannot place a card, you must pick up an extra card from the remainder of the deck. The players play clockwise from the dealer. <br> 

#### Winning a Game
The game can *ONLY* be won in normal mode. 

To win using one card:
If you have one card left in your hand - you must say "Last Card". Otherwise on your next turn you cannot play that card and *must* draw an additional card from the deck. If on or before your next turn you are able to play or get rid of this card, you win the game.

To win using multiple cards:
If you plan to place multiple cards on your final turn, you do not need to declare "Last Card". However these cards *MUST* adhere to the matching cards conditions for placing stacks.

You cannot win on the following cards:
- Ace/1
- 2/5 - as this begins fight mode, see the paragraph below

If you place your final card during fight mode OR you place an attack card to start fight mode, you are still in the game *UNTIL* fight mode ends. However, you win by default if fight mode ends and you still have no cards in your hand. If multiple people have empty hands at the end of fight mode, they enter the **THUNDERDOME**. In the **THUNDERDOME** participants duel to the death by drawing a random card from the deck, and compare to see who has the higher number - the higher number being a winner. If both/multiple players draw the highest card then they will have to rematch and draw another card until a winner is determined.

#### What are Matching Cards?

- Same Number: If the middle card is a `3 of hearts` you can put any card ontop that has the numeric value of `3`
- Same Suit: If the middle card is a `5 of spades` you can put any card ontop that has the suit value of `spades`
- Stacking the Same Number: If the middle card is a `7 of diamonds` and you have the `7 of clubs` and the `7 of spades` you can put both cards down at the same time, the order is up to you
- Ascending/Descending Stacks: If the middle card is a `6 of clubs` and you have the `7 of clubs`, `8 of clubs` and `9 of clubs` you can put all the cards down in ascending order but they all <i>must</i> be of the same suit. 
- Jokers and Aces: You can put these on top of any middle card, however you cannot end the game on said card - you <i>must</i> pick up another one from the deck

When placing stacks, only the top card will have an effect, all cards underneath will be benign. For example, if you play `4 of clubs + 5 of clubs + 6 of clubs` the 4 and 5 act as benign cards, however if you play `3 of clubs + 4 of clubs + 5 of clubs` *only* the top card - in this case the 5 will have an effect and thus start fight mode.

### In Fight Mode

<i>Fight Mode</i> is activated as soon as someone places a card with the numeric value of 2 or 5. During <i>Fight Mode</i>, only <i>Fight Cards</i> of any suit or value can be placed on the previous card. The matching cards rules do not apply in this case. 

An attack is an attempt to force the player after you to pick up a multiple amount of cards as their turn.

There are two types of cards in *Fight Mode* - Attack Cards and Defense Cards.

- Attack Cards - these cards attack the player directly next to you, either by adding a heavier blow to the attack, or by changing the direction of the attack.
- Defense Cards - these cards prevent the effects of the attack blow.

#### Fight Cards and Examples

Attack Cards consist of:
- 2's and 5's - denoting how many cards the next player has to pickup. The amount of cards that a player must pick up can be increased by having the next player place 2's or 5's onto the existing attack blow.
- 6's - these can only be placed after a defence card to undo it's effects and continue the attack on the next player.
- 9's and 12's - these change the direction of the attack but not the severity of the attack blow. A 9 will defer the attack to the next player, but a 12 will change the direction of play, meaning that the previous player recieves the attack.

Defense Cards consist of:
- 3's and 7's - this blocks the effects of the attack. However this can be undone by a 6.

Lets say someone started an attack by playing a 5. The 9 passes on the total cards needed to be picked up onto the next person.

`5 -> 9` OR `5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 9`

6's can only be placed after a block.

`5 -> 7 -> 6`

More 2's and 5's can be placed after 6's and/or 9's, increasing the total amount of cards that eventually need to be picked up.

`5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 2` OR `5 -> 9 -> 5`

#### Fight mode only ends on either of two conditions:
1) A player cannot defend an attack OR redirect the attack, and they *MUST* pick up the number of cards from the attack total.
2) A player blocks an attack, and the player after is unable to reverse this block. 

## Card Values

Each card has it's own special abilities depending on the mode that the game is in. For example, a card with an ability in *Normal Mode* but no ability in *Fight Mode* is unable to be used in *Fight Mode*, and a card with a *Fight Mode* ability can only be used as a benign card during *Normal Mode*.

| Card     | Normal Mode      | Fight Mode  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Ace/Joker | Change the suit to whichever the player chooses. | |
| 2 | Fight Mode is activated, continue to Fight Mode ability | The next player has to pick up two cards for their turn. This can be blocked or redirected. |
| 3 | | The effects of the attack are blocked. Can only be unblocked by a 6. |
| 4 | After placing this card the next player gets to play a card of their choice. | |
| 5 | Fight Mode is activated, continue to Fight Mode ability | The next player has to pick up five cards for their turn. This can be blocked or redirected. |
| 6 | | Place this undo card on a 3 or 7 to undo the effects of the shield and force the next player to continue attack mode. |
| 7 | | The effects of the attack are blocked. Can only be unblocked by a 6. |
| 8 | A player of your choosing has to take a random card from your hand. | |
| 9 | | You pass the attack to the player after you. |
| 10 | The player after you misses a turn. | |
| Jack/11 | The rotation/player order reverses. | |
| Queen/12 | | The attack direction reverses. |
| King/13 | The player after you has to do the chicken dance before their turn. This does not affect actual gameplay, but the player loses their dignity. | |
